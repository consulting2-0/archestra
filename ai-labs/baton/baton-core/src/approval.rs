//! Authorities and process-local external approval.
//!
//! An [`Authority`] is one registered decision-maker: a name, the competence
//! it may exercise ([`AuthorityMandate`]), and a mode.
//!
//! - **Inline** authorities carry a decision function ([`AuthorityFn`]) the
//!   engine runs synchronously during waiver application. A Rust type cannot
//!   prove purity, so an inline fn means "allowed to run inline", not
//!   "formally established pure".
//! - **External** authorities carry no code. The engine routes a grant-bearing
//!   step (waiver, accept, endorse) to one, but never invokes the human,
//!   webhook, or judge model itself: the ruling re-enters through
//!   [`crate::engine::PolicyEngine::apply_approval`] with a [`PendingApproval`]
//!   the engine issued.
//!
//! A [`PendingApproval`] is opaque, linear (non-`Clone`), `Serialize`-only,
//! and bound to the exact trajectory revision, pending action, waiver,
//! targeted violations, and authority registration. Any state change —
//! including a process restart, since nothing can deserialize one —
//! invalidates it.
