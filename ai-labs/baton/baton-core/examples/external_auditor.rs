//! Read this quarter's invoices from the internal system (readable only by the
//! finance team), then e-mail the report to an *external auditor* who is **not**
//! a reader of that data. The send crosses the audience boundary and is the
//! first egress this turn — so baton routes it to a mandated sign-off that
//! *declassifies* it (endorses the auditor in) and *accepts* the egress, leaving
//! an audit record, rather than letting it out silently.
//!
//! Contrast with `recording_to_task`, where the boundary crossing (to the whole
//! public) is *refused*: same `AudienceExceeds` breach, opposite ruling —
//! because there no authority is mandated to vouch the recipient in.
//!
//! Run with `cargo run --example external_auditor`.
