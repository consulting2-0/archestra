//! Fetch a Grain recording (readable only by the internal team), then open an
//! issue on a *public* GitHub repo. A public issue egresses to `world` — a
//! sentinel recipient standing for the public (there is no e-mail for
//! "everyone"; see the design notes).
//!
//! No authority is registered, so the gate is fully fail-closed: the audience
//! breach to `world` is *terminal* — nothing declassifies it. Contrast with
//! `external_auditor`, where a mandated approver vouches the recipient in. Same
//! `AudienceExceeds` breach, opposite ruling.
//!
//! Run with `cargo run --example recording_to_task`.
