//! Label dimensions: the crate's three built-in instances of the generic
//! [`crate::preset`] algebras, plus their value types.
//!
//! Each dimension is a newtype over its preset and delegates its `combine` (the
//! taint fold) and adequacy relation to it; [`crate::value::ValueLabel::combine`]
//! applies the per-dimension combine, and nothing else in the crate invents
//! merge semantics.
//!
//! Per data dimension the combine is a commutative, idempotent semilattice,
//! and `Unknown` has a definite position in each (absorbing for audience and
//! effects; between `Trusted` and `Suspicious` for trust). This is the taint
//! fold — distinct from the sink-side adequacy relation, where `Unknown` is
//! instead incomparable → [`Adequacy::Unprovable`](crate::preset).
