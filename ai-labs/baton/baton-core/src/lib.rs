//! # baton-core
//!
//! A prototype information-flow policy engine for LLM agent trajectories, in
//! the language-based IFC tradition (Sabelfeld/Myers): instead of asking "did
//! this prompt pass a filter?", ask "can this value, derived from these
//! sources, legally flow into this sink?".
//!
//! The moving parts:
//!
//! - A [`turn::Trajectory`] owns an immutable, append-only store of labeled
//!   [`value::StoredValue`]s with full [`value::Provenance`]. Admission is
//!   engine-owned: ingress is the only caller-labeled path (the explicit
//!   trust boundary); every other value's label is computed inside the crate
//!   as the conservative fold of its mandatory dependency sets.
//! - A [`request::ToolRequest`] carries the executable
//!   [`request::ArgumentTree`] — recipients, paths, and payloads are values
//!   in this tree, and the canonical rendering handed out for dispatch comes
//!   from the exact tree the engine checked — plus the *control*
//!   dependencies of whatever selected the invocation. Requirements are
//!   checked against `L_flow = combine(L_args, L_control)` (the sink check
//!   behind [`contract::Requirements`]), so a sanitized payload cannot
//!   launder a secret-dependent tool or recipient choice.
//! - Effects are monotone trajectory state
//!   ([`audit::TrajectoryState::past_effects`]), committed when dispatch
//!   begins (a may-effect record: a later failure removes nothing). Audit is
//!   control-plane history ([`audit::AuditEvent`]), not a label field.
//! - Every mutation advances the trajectory's [`revision::Revision`];
//!   capabilities (the [`engine::ExecutionToken`]) are linear, bound to
//!   trajectory + revision + pending action, and spent on use.
//! - `Unknown` is a first-class value of audience, trust, and effects, and an
//!   unregistered tool is evaluable (all-`Unknown` output, `Unknown`
//!   effects). An unprovable flow is not accepted implicitly: it routes
//!   through the authority chain like a breach, and an acknowledge-only gap
//!   needs an `acknowledge_unknown`-competent [`approval::Authority`] to clear
//!   — gradual typing for agent stacks, fail-closed by default.
//!
//! One deliberate deviation from the original notes: the audience fold is
//! **intersection** (most-restrictive readers), not union — see
//! [`dimension::Audience`] for why union would make the sink check vacuous.
